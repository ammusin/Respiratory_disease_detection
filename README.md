Respiratory Disease Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the presence of respiratory diseases based on chest X-ray images. It leverages deep learning architectures such as **ResNet**, **DenseNet**, **CNN** and a **Hybrid Model (ResNet + DenseNet),(Mobinet + efficientNet)** to achieve accurate classification.
Features
- Predicts presence or absence of respiratory disease from chest X-ray images
- Utilizes  powerful CNN architectures: ResNet, DenseNet, , CNN and Hybrid
- Compares performance across models
- Trained and validated on a medical imaging dataset
- Built for potential use in clinical diagnosis support
